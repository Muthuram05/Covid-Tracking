We need to use three different libraries here.

tkinter – for GUI
matplotlib – to show data graphically
covid – to get COVID data
We have many posts based on tkinter so if you have any problem in tkinter then we suggest to read them.

You can install **matplotlib** using the pip command given below

`pip install matplotlib`

Python community has made a library to get the COVID-19 information easily.

Library is **covid** and its so simple to use.

Visit this site for more details of this library.

You can download it using the pip command given below.

`pip install covid`

##Note: python >= 3.6

Type this command in your terminal to install and use this library.

Now lets see and understand the code.
